* Realized I hadn't saved TODO in a long time.
*
* Remove any unnecessary event capture flags
* Remove any unnecessary stopPropagation, return true/false, cancelBubble calls
* Replace obsolete DOMMouseScroll and mousewheel handlers with wheel
* Replace mouseup/down/move handlers with pointerup/down/move
* Eliminate use of LiteGraph.pointerListenerAdd/Remove
* Every event gets a separate handler
* Every event target gets a seperate listener
*
* Do NOT change over references to mouse or variable names yet
* Replace var with const/let on smaller methods only when I trust myself
*
* editor/editor_mobile.html doesn't run workflows, silently
* nodes/base.js/Subgraph relies on JQuery 1.6* which is horrifically obsolete
*
