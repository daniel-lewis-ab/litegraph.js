# Salt Frontend

Salt Frontend uses the strengths of Vite, TailwindCSS, and the power of SWC with React.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url> salt-frontend
cd salt-frontend
npm install
```

## Scripts
- npm run dev: Launches the Vite dev server.
- npm run build: Compiles and bundles for production.
- npm run lint: Runs ESLint to catch issues.
- npm run lint-fix: Fixes ESLint issues automatically.
- npm run preview: Previews the build locally.


This setup includes Vite for a fast development experience, TailwindCSS for styling, and leverages SWC via the @vitejs/plugin-react for quick, efficient builds.
