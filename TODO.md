# 1. Unit Testing and Debugging

GL is getting close?
Done up to L3967, gltextures.js
110ish problems in lint
Expand on Jest testing to run tests for each class

# 2. Documentation

Set up JSDocs comments for Node, Link, Canvas

# 3. Fix Layout Errors (width/height/font/top/left)

Removed ones for context menu.  Others likely on canvas, editor, code, etc.

# Extend classes with a *Canvas class

Shift render related methods and properties to that.
